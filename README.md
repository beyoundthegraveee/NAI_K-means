A set of points is given: 
(a) 𝑃1=(2,10) 
(b) 𝑃2=(2,5) 
(c) 𝑃3=(8,4) 
d) 𝑃4=(5,8) 
e) 𝑃5=(7,5) 
f) 𝑃6=(6,4) 
g) 𝑃7=(1,2) 
(h) 𝑃8=(4,9) 
Use the k-means (Euclidean distance) algorithm to divide the set of points into 3 
groups. Take the points 𝑃1,𝑃4 and 𝑃7 as the initial centres. 
(a) Draw the points in the coordinate system and mark the initial centres. 
(b) Perform one epoch of the algorithm. 
(c) Determine the new centres and new focuses after the first epoch of learning. 
i) 
Check how many epochs are needed for the algorithm to complete.
